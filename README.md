# DeadlyDungeons
Top down tactical action game with a mage in the dungeon filled with deadly dark forces in C++, opengl and emscripten.

Overview
========

After being attacked by a necromancer of the local bar of your village, you find yourself strapped below the ground the deep abyss known as the deadly dungeons that is rumored to be inhabited by the dark forces. You feel different and quickly find out that in your attempt to escape his attack, you have gotten some of the evil mage's power stolen from him. Can this aid you to fight for your life in the dungeons? Can you escape the nightmares?

Technical overview
==================

* Written in C++(0x/14), OpenGL

* Builds on linux too
* Uses stb_image.h and glut
* Will be written to a fast coding competition so don't complain about the architecture. Still we try our bests with my friend!
